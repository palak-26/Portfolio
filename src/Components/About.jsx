            I am a final-year Computer Science undergraduate with a strong foundation in software development and a passion for building scalable, user-centric solutions. My technical expertise spans the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, enabling me to develop full-stack applications and write efficient, maintainable code. I am an open-source contributor with GirlScript Summer of Code, where I collaborated on real-world projects and worked within diverse development teams. Known for being adaptive, optimistic, and a fast learner, I thrive in collaborative environments and continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge. With a proactive mindset, strong communication skills, and a commitment to teamwork, I aim to contribute meaningfully to innovative and impact-driven engineering teams.
